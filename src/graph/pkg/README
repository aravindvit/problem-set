The problem is to write a Build System, which accepts the following command

DEPEND <list of pkgs>(example DEPEND SPRING HIBERNATE JETTY)
 - After adding HIBERNATE as dependent for SPRING (if another command DEPEND HIBERNATE SPRING executed it should fail)

INSTALL <pkgName> (ex INSTALL SPRING)

 - Install pkg and all its corresponding dependencies

REMOVE <pkgName> (ex REMOVE SPRING)
 - Dont remove if there is parent dependency
 - remove all the dependencies added for this package

LIST
 - List all the installed packages
